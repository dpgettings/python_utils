python_utils
============

A repo for some potentially-useful Python code I've developed in the course of my thesis research.


### ``fits_utils.py``

Utilities for dealing with FITS tables. Nearly all of this is probably obviated by updates to Astropy, making FITS tables interface with the Table class. But included here anyway.


### ``hist_functions.py``

For now, just contains my rewrite of Numpy's ``histogramdd()`` function, called ``histogram_nd()``.
